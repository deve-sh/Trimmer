# Editing Styles

The Stylesheet is pure CSS formed without the use of any preprocessor like SASS. Its small and efficient for a small Web Application like this one.

Different sections of the Web Application have been highlighted using Comments and names of classes and anchors/IDs have been appropriately named to be human understandable.

Example : 

```css
/* Install Page */

.installmain{
	width: 100%;
	margin: 0;
	padding: 1rem;
	background: #141E30;
	text-align: center;
	background: #2193b0;
	min-height: 100vh;
}
```

The above code block specifies the beginning of the components responsible for the Installation Page and the styles of its master components are provided hence.

Just edit the styles to your wish and refresh the server to view your changes.

There is absolutely no seperate styling present in any of the PHP files unlike a few of my previous projects, hence, this one is much more streamlined and efficient. Enjoy.

I was planning on building an Administrator Dashboard in order to edit the styles and Configurations, but nevermind, I guess I am just a bit too lazy to create something that looks worse than a Text Editor.
